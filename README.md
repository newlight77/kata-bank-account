# Bank-Account-Kata

## Kata Statement

Bank Account kata for practice TDD implemented by Jorge SÃ¡nchez (Xurxodev)

Think of your personal bank account experience

When in doubt, go for the simplest solution

### Requirements

These are requirements for kata.

#### Initial requirements

* Deposit (negative not permitted)
* Withdrawal (negative not permitted)  
* GetBalance  
* Account statement (date, quantity, balance) 
* Statement printing 

#### Extra requirements if you feel with force :)

* Deposit and Withdrawal (EUR and USD)

### Getting started

Start by defining the acceptance tests. 
Start from the simplest to the most complex cases by taking baby steps.

## My Approach


### Technical stack 

I'm using Springboot with Java.

### Divide to conquer

We are going slice all rules per User Story :

* US1 : Deposit (negative not permitted)
* US2 : Withdrawal (negative not permitted)  
* US3 : GetBalance  
* US4 : Account statement (date, quantity, balance) 
* US5 : Statement printing 

### Methodology

I'll proceed with TDD and cover every single rule with small commits to represent the work per step.
