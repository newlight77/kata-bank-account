## Kata Statement

Bank Account kata for practice TDD implemented by [Jorge SÃ¡nchez (Xurxodev)](https://github.com/xurxodev/Bank-Account-Kata/blob/master/README.md)

Think of your personal bank account experience

When in doubt, go for the simplest solution

### Requirements

These are requirements for kata.

#### Extra requirements if you feel with force :)

* Deposit and Withdrawal (EUR and USD)

## My Approach

### Technical stack 

I'm using Springboot with Java.

### Story Mapping

Let's translate the features above into user stories :

* US1 : Deposit (negative not permitted)

> As a bank client, I want to make a deposit in my account.

>> - Given a client with an account`
>> -   and the the initial balance in that account is 0$`
>> - When he makes a deposit of 100 $
>> - Then the balance in the account is update to 100 $

>> - Given a client with an account
>> -   and the the initial balance in that account is 0$
>> - When he makes a deposit of 100 $
>> - Then the operation is not allowed

* US2 : Withdrawal (negative not permitted)  

> As a bank client, I want to withdraw money from my account.

>> - Given a client with an account
>> -   and the the initial balance in that account is 100$
>> - When he withdraws 100 $ from the account
>> - Then the balance in the account is update to 0 $

>> - Given a client with an account
>> -   and the the initial balance in that account is 100$
>> - When he withdraws -100 $ from the account
>> - Then the operation is not allowed

* US3 : GetBalance  

> As a bank client, I want to know the balkance in my account.

>> - Given a client with an account
>> -   and the the initial balance in that account is 100$
>> - When he retrieve the balance in the account
>> - Then the balance 100 $ is showed

* US4 : Account statement (date, quantity, balance) 

> As a bank client, I want to see my account statement.

>> - Given a client with an account
>> -   and the the initial balance in that account is 100$
>> -   and there are 3 operations (+100, +200 and +50)    
>> - When he retrieves the statement of the account
>> - Then the 3 operations (+100, +200 and +50) with date, amount and balance are shown

* US5 : Statement printing 

> As a bank client, I want to print my account statement.

>> - Given a client with an account
>> -   and the the initial balance in that account is 100$
>> -   and there are 3 operations (+100, +200 and +50)    
>> - When he prints the statement of the account
>> - Then the 3 operations (+100, +200 and +50) with date, amount and balance are printed
